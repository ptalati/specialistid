Future You Protection</strong></p><ul><li>How easy will reordering be next year?</li><li>What if someone else inherits this responsibility?</li><li>Will you be able to figure out what you ordered 12 months from now?</li></ul><h3><strong>Questions to Ask All Vendors (Copy and Paste These)</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>\"What's your total delivered cost?\"</strong> (because surprises are for birthdays, not invoices)</li><li><strong>\"What's your realistic delivery timeline?\"</strong> (and actually listen to their answer)</li><li><strong>\"Who do I contact when something goes wrong?\"</strong> (test this - if they don't respond to this question quickly, that's your answer)</li><li><strong>\"How easy is reordering next year?\"</strong> (because future you is counting on present you)</li></ol>"
